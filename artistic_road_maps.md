# Dynamic Map Visualizer

The **Dynamic Map Visualizer** is a Python-based tool designed to generate visually compelling maps of city street networks and waterways using OpenStreetMap data. It processes geospatial data to create customizable maps with various pre-defined color schemes such as `Red-Gold` and `Midnight-Teal`.

Key features include dynamic adjustment of map titles, subtitles, and output file names based on the selected location, ensuring personalized and organized results. The tool supports flexible customization, including user-defined fonts and text colors, delivering high-quality visualizations suitable for presentations or creative projects.

This project efficiently combines geospatial analysis with data visualization to produce polished, ready-to-use maps.
