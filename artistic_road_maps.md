Dynamic Map Visualizer: Visualizing City Networks with Style

This project demonstrates my expertise in data visualization and geospatial analysis through the development of a Dynamic Map Visualizer. Using Python and a combination of powerful libraries like OSMnx, NetworkX, and Matplotlib, I created a tool that generates stunning, customizable maps of city street networks and waterways directly from OpenStreetMap data.

The tool provides an interactive experience by allowing users to choose from a variety of pre-defined color schemes, including vibrant themes like Red-Gold, Midnight-Teal, and Pink. Titles and subtitles are dynamically generated based on the city name and its geographical coordinates, adding context and personalization to each map. For further flexibility, users can override text colors or apply custom fonts to suit specific aesthetic needs.

From dense urban grids to sprawling road networks, the visualizer adapts seamlessly to any city's layout. It automatically adjusts the map's output file names based on the city name and selected color scheme, ensuring an organized workflow. The final outputs are polished, ready-to-share map images that are ideal for presentations, portfolios, or creative projects.

This project reflects my ability to:

    Work with geospatial data and APIs (OpenStreetMap).
    Develop adaptable, scalable, and user-focused Python tools.
    Apply creative and technical solutions to produce visually appealing outputs.

By combining technical precision with artistic design, this project showcases not only my programming skills but also my attention to detail and aesthetic sensibility.
